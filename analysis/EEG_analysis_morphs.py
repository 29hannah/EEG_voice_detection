"""This script contains the code to analyze and plot the EEG and behavioral data to compare the processing of ambiguous
sounds
Main purpose is to visualize the results; Permutation cluster test results and decoder are run in another script

# GFP plus permutation cluster test


# Topo map F-score


# ERP and permutation cluster test at electrode of main interest


# F-score between the morph ratios versus perceptual difference (delta yes responses)
# F-score between the morph ratios and voice versus perceptual difference (delta yes responses)
# F-score between the morph ratios and non voice versus perceptual difference (delta yes responses)


# Decoder accuracy morphs versus non voice over time
# Mean Decoder accuracy morphs versus non voice  in relation to percent voice responses

# Decoder accuracy morphs versus  voice over time
