"""This script contains the code to analyze and plot the EEG and behavioral data to compare the processing of vocal versus
non-vocal/environmental sounds
Main purpose is to visualize the results; Permutation cluster test results and decoder are run in another script
"""

#TODO "outsource" the permuation cluster test and decoder: only load the results to this script

# GFP plus permutation cluster test


# Topo map F-score


# ERP and permutation cluster test at electrode of main interest


# F-score as determined for top map versus behavioral discriminability


# Decoder accuracy over time


# Mean decoder accuracy and behavioral discriminability
